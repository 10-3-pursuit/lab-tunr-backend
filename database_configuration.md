# Explanation of Database Configuration

This document explains the purpose and functionality of the database configuration code.

## Purpose

The purpose of this code is to configure a connection to a PostgreSQL database using the `pg-promise` library and environment variables stored in a `.env` file. It establishes a connection to the database and logs information about the connection details.

## Code Explanation

1. **Import Required Modules**: The code imports the `pg-promise` library and the `dotenv` module, which is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file.

2. **Set Connection Configuration**: It defines a JavaScript object `cn` which contains the configuration details required to connect to the PostgreSQL database. These details include the host, port, database name, and user, retrieved from environment variables.

3. **Create Database Connection Object**: It creates a database connection object (`db`) using `pgp(cn)`, where `pgp` is a function provided by the `pg-promise` library, and `cn` contains the connection configuration.

4. **Establish Database Connection**: It attempts to connect to the database using the `connect()` method of the `db` object. If successful, it logs connection details such as the user, host, port, and database name. If there is an error during connection, it logs a database connection error.

5. **Export Database Connection Object**: Finally, it exports the `db` object, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

## Environment Variables

This code relies on environment variables to securely store sensitive information such as database credentials. The environment variables should be defined in a `.env` file located in the root directory of the project. The required environment variables include:

- `PG_HOST`: The hostname of the PostgreSQL server.
- `PG_PORT`: The port number on which the PostgreSQL server is running.
- `PG_DATABASE`: The name of the PostgreSQL database.
- `PG_USER`: The username used to authenticate with the PostgreSQL database.

## Conclusion

This code provides a flexible and secure way to configure a connection to a PostgreSQL database using `pg-promise` and environment variables. It establishes a connection to the database and logs connection details for verification. The use of environment variables ensures that sensitive information remains confidential and can be easily managed across different environments.
